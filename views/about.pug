			h2 Tips &amp; Tricks

			ul
				li Open a separate browser tab or window for each side when playing solo.
				li Use the middle mouse button to drag and scroll around the map.
				li Hold down the Shift key when mousing over a block or counter in order to magnify it.
				li The #[i Enter] and #[i Escape] keys open and close the chat box.
				li To invite your friends to a private game, send them the address of the join page.
				li Chat messages can only be seen by players who are part of a game. They are hidden from observers.
				li The #[img(src="/images/cog.svg")] menu has links to rules, player aids and other reference material. In some games you can also choose between alternative graphics and layout options.
				li The #[img(src="/images/earth-africa-europe.svg")] button hides all counters and markers, if you need to check something on the map that is obscured.
				li The #[img(src="/images/magnifying-glass.svg")] button shrinks the map to fit the screen width.
				li The #[img(src="/images/scroll-quill.svg")] button hides the game log and player status displays, so you can see more of the map.
				li The #[img(src="/images/chat-bubble.svg")] button lights up if you have unread chat messages.
				li The #[img(src="/images/cycle.svg")] button appears when the game is over, and can be used to quickly start a rematch.

			h2 Pace &amp; Etiquette

			p.
				For everyone's enjoyment, please respect the pace requests!
				If someone wants a fast game, don't join if you can only play one move per day.

			dl
				dt #{EMOJI_LIVE} Live
				dd.
					Let your opponents know if you're going away!
					If you need to resume the game another day, arrange a time when you can all continue,
					or agree to continue playing at a different pace.

				dt #{EMOJI_FAST} Fast
				dd.
					Turn on notifications so you can take your turns promptly.
					If you see that your opponent is online (the dot next to their name is filled in)
					then stay in the game for a while and perhaps you can play live for a bit.

				dt #{EMOJI_SLOW} Slow
				dd.
					If you create a game and know you can not play more than one move per day,
					please pick this option to set the appropriate expectations.

				dt Any
				dd.
					Anything goes. Read the game notice and adapt!
